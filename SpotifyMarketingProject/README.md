SPOTIFY MARKETING PROJECT

**Scenario:**

The project is beneficial to optimize efficient marketing campaign in the Music industry. Music labels and digital marketers make decisions to decide which tracks deserve marketing investments. If a company or a sole business person decides to investment they'll need reassurance of financial gain and not financial loss to maximize profit.

**Goal:**

Analyzing the dataset to get a predictive model for track popularity. Since the more popular a track is the potential chance that music labels and digital marketers can get financial gain with utilizing this model. A reminder that this does cover data from 2009-2025 and by the time the predictive model is made the data would be questioned to change. Must update data in correspondense to the timeframe desired for analysis.
