***Project 1: US Traffic Accidents***

Overview:

There are various traffic accidents that happen in the US. The Department of Transportation (DOT) wants to develop strategies with analytical data to improve road conditions and reduce accidents occuring across the US.

Objective:

With the provided US_Accidents_dataset, analyzing the dataset to see what facotrs contribute to high amount of accidents. As instructed for my comprehensive analysis, i will provide three data-driven insights that the DOT could utilize to reduce traffic accidents and improve road saftey.

Analytical Questions:

(1.) What times are accidents most occuring in a day?

(2.) Where are accidents happening in the US the most?

(3.) Which state has the most accidents?

(4.) How does optimizing travel routes do whenever there's a traffic congestion caused by any accident?

(5.) What factors causes the accidents to occur at an alarming rate?

Emphasizing the Relevancy of the data:

The importance of US_Accident dataset is that it contains analytical records of traffic accidents that have occurred in the United States. The purpose of this project by analyzing the data would allow to reduce the amount of accidents, pinpoint the location of high accident rates, analyze weather and time frame variables that contribute to accidents.

Concrete Benefits and Goals:

    * Optimize travel route: Redirect travel to reduce the amount of time needed for travel.
    * Predict dangerous and safe routes: Build predictive models from the data to help prevent further accidents.
    * Saftey Improvements: Better usage of resources such as lightings, road repairs, etc.
    * Resource Management: Helps minimize cost for repairs and allocate materials to where its most needed.

Identify Stockholders (Who is the audience?):

    The targeted audience would be officials that deal with transporation matters.
    * City and State Goverments: Allocate resources to high risk areas of accidents to ensure community saftey.
    * Emergency Providers: Optimize route and response time for better efficiency.
    * Transits: Optimizing delivery services to maintain quota and customer satisfaction.
    * General Public: Desirable need for safe traveling and shortcuts for either personal or work related matters.
Project Instructions
The project followed these key steps:

Setup the Project:

Downloaded the dataset using Kagglehub.

Business Understanding:

Define the problem clearly and identify key questions that your analysis should answer. Determine how success will be measured and what insights would be valuable to stakeholders.
Data Understanding:

Explore the US Accidents dataset to understand its structure, variables, scope, and limitations. Identify potential issues with the data and assess its suitability for addressing the business problem.
Data Preparation: Clean and preprocess the data, handling missing values, outliers, and duplicates. Create derived features that might provide additional insights (e.g., time of day categories, weather condition groupings).
Statistical Analysis:

Apply appropriate statistical methods to identify patterns, correlations, and significant factors.


Insights and Recommendations:  Interpret your findings in the context of the business problem.

To complete this project necessary materials:

The US Accidents dataset ("US_Accidents_March23.csv") downloaded from Kaggle. (import kagglehub)
Requieres to a Python environment with the necessary libraries installed (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn).
Dashboard: Created a Tableau dashboard to visualize key findings.
