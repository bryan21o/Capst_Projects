***Project 1: US Traffic Accidents***

Overview:

This project goal is to provide data-driven insights and actionable recommendations to the Department of Transportation (DOT) to reduce accidents occurring in the US as well improve road saftey.

Dataset:

The dataset used in this project is the US Accidents dataset downloaded from Kaggle, specifically the "US_Accidents_March23.csv" file. It contains detailed information about millions of traffic accidents recorded across the United States.

Business Case:

The Department of Transportation (DOT) wants to develop strategies to reduce traffic accidents and enhance road safety nationwide. This analysis provides valualbe statistics to support data-driven decision-making in providing recommendations to (DOT).

Project Goals:

Analyze the US Accidents dataset to identify patterns, trends, and contributing factors.
Provide three data-driven insights that the DOT can utilize to reduce traffic accidents and improve road safety.
Analytical Questions Explored
Where are the most accident-prone locations in the United States?
What are the most common causes or contributing factors to accidents?
How do accident rates vary by time (hour, day, month, season)?
What is the relationship between weather conditions and accident severity?
Are there trends in accident severity based on location or time?
How do traffic accidents impact traffic congestion and travel times?
Can we predict the likelihood of an accident occurring at a given time and place?
Project Steps
The project followed these key steps:

Setup the Project:

Downloaded the dataset using Kagglehub.

Business Understanding:

Define the problem clearly and identify key questions that your analysis should answer. Determine how success will be measured and what insights would be valuable to stakeholders.
Data Understanding:

Explore the US Accidents dataset to understand its structure, variables, scope, and limitations. Identify potential issues with the data and assess its suitability for addressing the business problem.
Data Preparation: Clean and preprocess the data, handling missing values, outliers, and duplicates. Create derived features that might provide additional insights (e.g., time of day categories, weather condition groupings).
Statistical Analysis:

Apply appropriate statistical methods to identify patterns, correlations, and significant factors.


Insights and Recommendations:  Interpret your findings in the context of the business problem.
