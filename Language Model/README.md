***Project 3: Large Language Models with AI***

**Overview:**

Build a machine learning solution for automatically summarizing dialogues using transformer-based models. You'll work with the SAMSum dataset to develop a BERT-based encoder-decoder architecture as well as the ChatGPT auto-regressive models that can condense conversations into concise, informative summaries.

Project test usage of:

- Process and prepare conversational text data for deep learning models.
- Implement and fine-tune transformer-based architectures.
- Train and optimize models efficiently.
- Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics.
- Analyze model outputs and identify strengths and limitations.
- Document your approach and results clearly.
